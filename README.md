# CDNperf

CDNperf monitors popular CDN sites and graphs this data.

## Development

1. `npm install`
2. `cp example.config.js config.js` and adjust as needed

In case you wish to add new frontend JS dependencies, tweak `component.json` and execute `bower install`. Note that these dependencies are revisioned at the repo so that bower isn't absolutely needed.
